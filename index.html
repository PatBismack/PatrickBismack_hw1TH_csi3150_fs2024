          <h2>Hello there!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Patrick Bismack, I am a senior at Oakland
            University majoring in computer science. I am from Rochester Hills,
            MI, but I currently live in Ann Arbor, MI. Growing up, my mother
            worked as a programmer which inspired my love for the field. Before
            joining the industry, I used to work as a professional snowboarder
            and in residential real estate. I've previously held roles as a
            full-stack developer and UI/UX designer at Ford Motor Company
            creating progressive web apps for transactional data. Currently, I
            work as a data engineer for Ford Credit working on loan originations
            and customer care analytics. In addition to my work, I hold a Google
            Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification and have spoken at a
            conference on integrating LLM into software development. In the
            future, I want to work as a software engineering manager. If you
            would like to find out more about me check my
